Around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I entered into a rabbit hole so enourmous I may never climb out of it. It all started with a clip of Shirakami Fubuki singing Scatman. And now I'm here; four years later still stuck listening to streams in the background of my work.

# Vtuber Culture


## Clipping Channels

Clippers hold a pivotal role within the VTuber ecosystem, acting as essential conduits between VTubers and potential fans. These dedicated individuals spend countless hours sifting through streams, highlighting memorable moments, and making them accessible to a wider audience. Their work not only amplifies the reach of VTubers but also serves as a curated introduction for newcomers to the community. The magic of clipping channels lies in their ability to distill hours of content into bite-sized, easily digestible pieces that capture the essence, humor, and talent of VTubers. This not only helps in breaking down language barriers but also showcases the diverse talents and personalities within the VTuber community.

## Kayfabe

Kayfabe is a term from professional wrestling which expresses the convention of presenting the staged performance as genuine/authentic. This term has been adapted to the vtuber scene to mean one's keeping up the illusion of the truth of one's lore.

The concept of kayfabe extends beyond the ring, weaving its way into the heart of VTuber culture. This theatrical portrayal, where VTubers immerse themselves and their audience in a constructed persona or narrative, creates a unique blend of storytelling and entertainment. It allows fans to suspend disbelief and engage with characters on a level that transcends the ordinary, fostering a rich, immersive world where fantasy and reality blur. The artistry behind maintaining kayfabe, while being transparent about its performative nature, invites fans to partake in a shared illusion, creating a bond that is both intimate and expansive.

Whether it be Gura continually claiming to be a shark girl from Atlantis or Fauna professing that she is mother nature, kayfabe is an integral part of the vtuber community. However, unlike wrestling, kayfabe is not the fount from which we derive entertainment from the genre. It is more like a necessary but not sufficient condition to be able to call oneself a genuine vtuber: it won't make you loved by itself, but you must have a kayfabe in order to be successful.

## Community Interaction

### Reddit

Reddit acts as a bustling hub for the VTuber community, offering a mosaic of fan art, discussions, memes, and news updates. Each VTuber or agency has dedicated subreddits where fans from around the globe converge to share their admiration, creativity, and thoughts. This platform facilitates a sense of belonging and community among fans, providing a space where their voices can be heard and their contributions celebrated. The democratic nature of Reddit, where content is upvoted based on community approval, ensures that the most engaging, humorous, or insightful posts gain visibility, fostering a dynamic and interactive fan culture.


### Discord

Discord serves as the living room for the VTuber communityâ€”a place where fans gather to chat in real-time, share content, and participate in community events. Many VTubers host their own official servers, offering a direct line of communication with their audience. These servers often become micro-communities, where fans can make personal connections, discuss streams, and even organize community projects or events. The real-time interaction on Discord enhances the communal experience, making fans feel closer to the VTubers they support and fostering a tight-knit community.

### /vt/

The 4chan /vt/ board is somewhat of an enigma in the vtuber community. Watching its denizens treat viewer and subscriber counts like sports betting is genuinely hilarious.

There is an assortment of subcommunities on the board which are constantly at war, as can be seen in this video.

This board is a cesspool for tribalism.

### PL Culture (nyfco)

Past Life Culture (PL Culture) within the VTuber community refers to the discussions, speculations, and sometimes the acknowledgement of VTubers' identities or activities before they adopted their virtual personas. This aspect of VTuber fandom is nuanced, with varying degrees of acceptance and sensitivity both among fans and VTubers themselves.
