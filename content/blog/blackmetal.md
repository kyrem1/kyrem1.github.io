I never play my favorite genre for others. I'm perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.

A couple times, I've been asked about why I enjoy the "noise" that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.


I can't quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.

Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal. 

Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal. 

## An era of turmoil : Second Wave
The second wave of black metal is marked by stauch anti-christian imagery and senseless violence within the scene. Through the antics of the members of the band Mayhem, black metal earned a twisted place in the eye of the public. This is not the black metal I speak of.

Mayhem somewhat permanently tainted the public perception of the genre, even within heavy metal circles. Their antics have made it quite difficult for the scene to ever obtain even a morsel of mainstream success.


## Third Wave

There are various flavors of black metal with complex emotional storylines:
* DSBM - Depressive Suicidal Black Metal
* ABM - Atmospheric Black Metal
* Pacifist Black Metal


### Depressive Black Metal (DSBM)
The first of these, DSBM, is precisely what it sounds like. However, for me at least, the depressive side of the music is somewhat uplifting. Its a hard feeling to explain.

Modern classics in this genre include Leviathan's debut studio album *The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide*, Thy Light's *Suici.De.Pression*, and Silencer's *Death - Pierce Me*.

There is a large number of truly brilliant one person projects in this subgenre, including Leviathan as mentioned above. Noisey did a great 3-part interview series covering Leviathan, Striborg, and Xasthur, all one man DSBM projects.

### Atmospheric Black Metal
Atomospheric black metal displays its emotion through a *slow burn*. It is often said that this music is meant to be listened to outside in the snow. My recommendation for this corner of black metal is the Russian band (TODO add Russian) (Path)

### Pacifist Black Metal
Pacifist black metal is my favorite of the bunch. The majority of bands under this genre are World War I remembrance bands (e.b. Kanonfieber, Minenwerfer, 1914) . There is a palpable sense of regret in this music, at times somewhat crushing. To see what I'm talking about, listen to *Der Blutharsch* by Minenwerfer. When it's entire 17 minute runtime is listened to in a single sitting, I can guarantee that it will evoke an incredibly impactful feeling.
