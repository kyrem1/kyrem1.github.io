I never play my favorite genre on the aux. I'm perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.

A couple times, I've been asked about why I enjoy the "noise" that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.

I can't quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.

Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal. 

Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal.
