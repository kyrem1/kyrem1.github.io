Dear Mathematics,

I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn't it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn't notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming. I'm expected to be an "adult," whatever that is. I'm expected to have thrown away my playful side, to contribute to the mollochian machine that we call industrial society.

Because of you, I have other options. I don't have to forget how to play.

Oddly enough, through you I have learned an incredible amount about myself. Through you, I have slowly been discovering who I am and what type of person I desire to be.

You are always eager to let me know just how little I know, but honestly, I've gotten used to that feeling. I actually revel in it now. There is something existentially freeing about knowing full well that I will never know anything and still trying anyways. This awareness keeps me sane. No other subject makes you feel comfortable feeling stupid. 

You've taught me so many lessons:

- There is always someone better, so don't make it a race
- You will know nothing, and that is okay
- We are all just faking it
- There is no replacement for hard work. Genius isn't a factor. What you see as genius is likely the culmination of more work than you can imagine.
