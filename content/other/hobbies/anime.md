### My current 3x3
![img](3x3anime.jpg)

Here are my above 3x3 entries listed from left to right and top to bottom:
- Gankutsuou
    - An anime adaptation of the classic novel *The Count of Monte Cristo*, set in 5053 space-France. It takes the best revenge story ever written into the world of anime. Has a wonderful slow build just like the novel, where the Count sets up dominoes in front of your eyes but you just don't know it yet. Once the dominoes start to fall, this show becomes purely epic.
- Shiki
    - Since I went in *completely blind*, my experience with this one during the first half of the show is likely different than others; however, I actually think that this is the ideal state-of-mind to begin this show with. As such, spoiler tags ahead. 
- Sakura-sou
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes
    - Imagine Star Wars but with strategic warfare backed by famous concertos/operas instead of lightsaber fights. One of the first space operas.
- Log Horizon
- Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
- Serial Experiments Lain
- Steins Gate
- Clannad: After Story
