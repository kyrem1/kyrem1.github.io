Here are my above 3x3 entries listed from left to right and top to bottom:

- [*Portal of I*, Ne Obliviscaris]()
    - TODO 
- [*Chet Baker Sings*]()
    - TODO 
- [*For You*, Tatsuro Yamashita]()
    - TODO 
- [*All of Me*, Masayoshi Takanaka]()
    - TODO 
- [*N.O.I.S.E.*, Ghostemane]()
    - TODO 
- [*Exercises in Futility*, mgla]()
    - TODO 
- [*World is Yours*, Mass of the Fermenting Dregs]()
    - From the first few seconds, this album exudes a sense of freedom that is hard to find in the modern music landscape. I would say that this work is closest to the excellent FLCL soundtrack by The Pillows. This is music that makes you feel like a kid again.
- [*Dopethrone*, Electric Wizard]()
    - This album is for those who take their coffee black and bitter. It will make you *feel* that the world is on an inevitable death march towards a cruel future with no chance of return.
- [*MadVillany*, MF Doom]()
    - TODO
