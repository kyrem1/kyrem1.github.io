I am a 2nd year undergraduate currently studying operator algebras under [Dr. Benjamin Hayes](https://sites.google.com/site/benhayeshomepage/) at the University of Virginia, partially supported by NSF grant DMS-2000105.

I am interested in various areas including:
- Deformation/Rigidity theory for von Neumann algebras
- $W^*$-rigidity for Group von Neumann algberas
- Type-$II_1$ Subfactor Theory
- Quantum Information Theory

During high school, I took the a large amount of undergraduate and some graduate courses via dual enrollment at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics-statistics/index.aspx). 

During that time, I received mentorship from [Dr. Thomas Bieske](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics-statistics/people/faculty/thomas-bieske.aspx) and [Dr. Brendan Nagle](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics-statistics/people/faculty/brendan-nagle.aspx).
