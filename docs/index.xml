      <title>Why Black Metal?</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal.</p>
<p>Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal.</p>
<h2 id="an-era-of-turmoil--second-wave">An era of turmoil : Second Wave</h2>
<p>The second wave of black metal is marked by stauch anti-christian imagery and senseless violence within the scene. Through the antics of the members of the band Mayhem, black metal earned a twisted place in the eye of the public. This is not the black metal I speak of.</p>

<p>Mayhem somewhat permanently tainted the public perception of the genre, even within heavy metal circles. Their antics have made it quite difficult for the scene to ever obtain even a morsel of mainstream success.</p>
<p>The second wave style represents the baseline of black metal which further subgenres build upon. For something to even be considered &ldquo;black metal,&rdquo; it must at least take some inspiration from this distinct era.</p>
<h2 id="third-wave">Third Wave</h2>
<p>There are various flavors of black metal with complex emotional storylines:</p>
<ul>
<li>DSBM - Depressive Black Metal</li>
<li>ABM - Atmospheric Black Metal</li>
<li>Pacifist Black Metal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="depressive-black-metal-dsbm">Depressive Black Metal (DSBM)</h3>
<p>The first of these, DSBM, is precisely what it sounds like. However, for me at least, the depressive side of the music is somewhat uplifting. Its a hard feeling to explain.</p>
<p>Modern classics in this genre include Leviathan&rsquo;s debut studio album <em>The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide</em>, Thy Light&rsquo;s <em>Suici.De.Pression</em>, and Silencer&rsquo;s <em>Death - Pierce Me</em>.</p>

  </a>
</div>


<p>There is a large number of truly brilliant one person projects in this subgenre, including Leviathan as mentioned above. Noisey did a great 3-part interview series covering Leviathan, Striborg, and Xasthur, all one man DSBM projects.</p>

<h3 id="atmospheric-black-metal">Atmospheric Black Metal</h3>
<p>Atomospheric black metal displays its emotion through a <em>slow burn</em>.
Songs are often significantly longer in this subgenre. Some say that this music is meant to be listened to outside in the snow. My recommendation for this corner of black metal is the Russian band Путь (/putʲ/, meaning &ldquo;path&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id="pacifist-black-metal">Pacifist Black Metal</h3>
<p>Pacifist black metal is my favorite of the bunch. The majority of bands under this genre are World War I remembrance bands (e.b. Kanonenfieber, Minenwerfer, 1914) . There is a palpable sense of regret in this music, at times somewhat crushing. To see what I&rsquo;m talking about, listen to <em>Der Blutharsch</em> by Minenwerfer (first 17 minutes of the album below) in a single sitting. I can guarantee a religious experience.</p>

<div class="container" style="width: 930px; max-width: 80%;">
  <a class="aimg" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDtXNckpqvc">
  <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3252171933_10.jpg"  >
  </a>
</div>

<p>This subgenre is chalk full of poignant imagery, from the depiction of an Austrian mountaineer soldier on the hills of the Alps in Minenwerfer&rsquo;s <em>Alpenpässe</em> to an anti-war propaganda poster by the Social Democratic Party of Hungary from around 1918 in Kanonenfieber&rsquo;s <em>Menschenmühle</em>, pacifist black metal understands its own importance in serving as a reminder for all those listening: <em>never again</em>.</p>

      <description>MyAnimeList About 3x3s in the Anime Community &amp;ldquo;3x3s&amp;rdquo; in the anime community refer to a grid of nine images arranged in a three-by-three format, each representing an anime that the person has chosen as their favorites or as representative of their taste. This format allows anime fans to quickly and visually share their preferences with others, sparking discussions and helping to find common ground or explore new titles.
Creating a 3x3 is often seen as a personal and introspective activity, as it requires the individual to reflect on which anime have had the most significant impact on them or resonate with their preferences.</description>

<p>&ldquo;3x3s&rdquo; in the anime community refer to a grid of nine images arranged in a three-by-three format, each representing an anime that the person has chosen as their favorites or as representative of their taste. This format allows anime fans to quickly and visually share their preferences with others, sparking discussions and helping to find common ground or explore new titles.</p>
<p>Creating a 3x3 is often seen as a personal and introspective activity, as it requires the individual to reflect on which anime have had the most significant impact on them or resonate with their preferences. The choices can vary widely, from mainstream hits to obscure gems, showcasing the diversity within the anime community.</p>
<p>Moreover, 3x3s can evolve over time, reflecting the changing tastes and experiences of the individual. They are often shared on social media platforms, anime forums, and community groups, leading to exchanges of opinions, recommendations, and sometimes debates about the merits of certain anime.</p>
<p>In essence, the 3x3 serves as a snapshot of a person&rsquo;s anime journey, encapsulating their past experiences, current favorites, and future interests in a compact, visually appealing format.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="2020-2023-3x3">2020-2023 3x3</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="3x3anime.jpg" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>Here are my above 3x3 entries listed from left to right and top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou">Gankutsuou</a>
<ul>
<li>An anime adaptation of the classic novel <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, set in 5053 space-France. It takes the best revenge story ever written into the world of anime. Has a wonderful slow build just like the novel, where the Count sets up dominoes in front of your eyes but you just don&rsquo;t know it yet. Once the dominoes start to fall, this show becomes purely epic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki">Shiki</a>
<ul>
<li>Since I went in <em>completely blind</em>, my experience with this one during the first half of the show is likely different than others; however, I actually think that this is the ideal state-of-mind to begin this show with. As such, spoiler tags ahead. Basically, it took me like 4-5 episodes to realize this show was about vampires. This show is terrifying not in its literal horrific aspects, but in its portrayal of the lengths by which humans will go to preserve their own existence. Truly harrowing, this anime left me empty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakura-sou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo">Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo</a>
<ul>
<li>A cute romcom that explores the ideas of mediocrity in the face of overwhelming genius. It provides a path to contentedness following ones realization that, no matter what you are doing, there will always be someone better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</a>
<ul>
<li>Imagine Star Wars but with strategic warfare backed by famous concertos/operas instead of lightsaber fights. One of the first space operas. It explores the age old question of whether one should prefer a poor democracy or an impeccable autocracy. The nuance in this show comes from the fact that it never seeks to answer this question, but merely provides viewers with the necessary prompting to come to their own conclusions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon">Log Horizon</a>
<ul>
<li>What type of political system would arise in a fantasy world running on game logic where the population is comprised of MMO gamers? Log Horizon explores this question in a thorougly intelligent manner. The best isekai by far. This show is largely dialogue-driven, so if you are looking for mainly action-based progression then this show is not for you. See Digibro&rsquo;s youtube analysis series of this show for further details on why it&rsquo;s genius.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Koukaku_Kidoutai__Stand_Alone_Complex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a>
<ul>
<li>The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> film was the progenitor for sci-fi anime and set the tone for the genre. It utilized the setting to address incredibly poigniant themes such as the nature of intelligence and the soul. The spin-off series <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> further pursues these themes with the precision of a scalpel. The show has thematic fish to fry and it isn&rsquo;t afraid to go all in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial Experiments Lain</a>
<ul>
<li>TODO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate">Steins Gate</a>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard to write about things which embed themselves within your core memory, as you can&rsquo;t imagine what it was like before you experienced said thing. Steins Gate is one of those shows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad__After_Story">Clannad: After Story</a>
<ul>
<li>Even though I skipped the original Clannad, this series still made me ball for days on end. I don&rsquo;t think anything has ever hit me as hard as this show has. Truly an emotional masterpiece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
