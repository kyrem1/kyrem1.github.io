      <title>A Thank You Letter to Math</title>

      <description>Dear Mathematics,
I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn&amp;rsquo;t it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming. I&amp;rsquo;m expected to be an &amp;ldquo;adult,&amp;rdquo; whatever that is.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Mathematics,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn&rsquo;t it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming. I&rsquo;m expected to be an &ldquo;adult,&rdquo; whatever that is. I&rsquo;m expected to have thrown away my playful side, to contribute to the mollochian machine that we call industrial society.</p>
<p>Because of you, I have other options. I don&rsquo;t have to forget how to play.</p>
<p>TODO <em>insert picture of young James</em></p>
<p>Oddly enough, through you I have learned an incredible amount about myself. Through you, I have slowly been discovering who I am and what type of person I desire to be.</p>
<p>You are always eager to let me know just how little I know, but honestly, I&rsquo;ve gotten used to that feeling. I actually revel in it now. There is something existentially freeing about knowing full well that I will never know anything and still trying anyways. This awareness keeps me sane. No other subject makes you feel comfortable feeling stupid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taught me so many lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always someone better, so don&rsquo;t make it a race</li>
<li>You will know nothing, and that is okay</li>
<li>We are all just faking it</li>
<li>There is no replacement for hard work. Genius isn&rsquo;t a factor. What you see as genius is likely the culmination of more work than you can imagine.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Why Black Metal?</title>
      <link>https://kyrem1.github.io/blog/blackmetal/</link>

      <description>I never play my favorite genre for others. I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.
A couple times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.
I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never play my favorite genre for others. I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.</p>
<p>A couple times, I&rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal.</p>
<p>Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal.</p>
<h2 id="an-era-of-turmoil--second-wave">An era of turmoil : Second Wave</h2>
<p>The second wave of black metal is marked by stauch anti-christian imagery and senseless violence within the scene. Through the antics of the members of the band Mayhem, black metal earned a twisted place in the eye of the public. This is not the black metal I speak of.</p>

</div>


<p>Mayhem somewhat permanently tainted the public perception of the genre, even within heavy metal circles. Their antics have made it quite difficult for the scene to ever obtain even a morsel of mainstream success.</p>
<h2 id="third-wave">Third Wave</h2>
<p>There are various flavors of black metal with complex emotional storylines:</p>
<ul>
<li>DSBM - Depressive Suicidal Black Metal</li>
<li>ABM - Atmospheric Black Metal</li>
<li>Pacifist Black Metal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="depressive-black-metal-dsbm">Depressive Black Metal (DSBM)</h3>
<p>The first of these, DSBM, is precisely what it sounds like. However, for me at least, the depressive side of the music is somewhat uplifting. Its a hard feeling to explain.</p>
<p>Modern classics in this genre include Leviathan&rsquo;s debut studio album <em>The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide</em>, Thy Light&rsquo;s <em>Suici.De.Pression</em>, and Silencer&rsquo;s <em>Death - Pierce Me</em>.</p>

<p>There is a large number of truly brilliant one person projects in this subgenre, including Leviathan as mentioned above. Noisey did a great 3-part interview series covering Leviathan, Striborg, and Xasthur, all one man DSBM projects.</p>

<h3 id="atmospheric-black-metal">Atmospheric Black Metal</h3>
<p>Atomospheric black metal displays its emotion through a <em>slow burn</em>. It is often said that this music is meant to be listened to outside in the snow. My recommendation for this corner of black metal is the Russian band (TODO add Russian) (Path)</p>
<h3 id="pacifist-black-metal">Pacifist Black Metal</h3>
<p>Pacifist black metal is my favorite of the bunch. The majority of bands under this genre are World War I remembrance bands (e.b. Kanonfieber, Minenwerfer, 1914) . There is a palpable sense of regret in this music, at times somewhat crushing. To see what I&rsquo;m talking about, listen to <em>Der Blutharsch</em> by Minenwerfer. When it&rsquo;s entire 17 minute runtime is listened to in a single sitting, I can guarantee that it will evoke an incredibly impactful feeling.</p>

      <description>MyAnimeList My current 3x3 Here are my above 3x3 entries listed from left to right and top to bottom:
Gankutsuou An anime adaptation of the classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo, set in 5053 space-France. It takes the best revenge story ever written into the world of anime. Has a wonderful slow build just like the novel, where the Count sets up dominoes in front of your eyes but you just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.</description>

<p>Here are my above 3x3 entries listed from left to right and top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/239/Gankutsuou">Gankutsuou</a>
<ul>
<li>An anime adaptation of the classic novel <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, set in 5053 space-France. It takes the best revenge story ever written into the world of anime. Has a wonderful slow build just like the novel, where the Count sets up dominoes in front of your eyes but you just don&rsquo;t know it yet. Once the dominoes start to fall, this show becomes purely epic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki">Shiki</a>
<ul>
<li>Since I went in <em>completely blind</em>, my experience with this one during the first half of the show is likely different than others; however, I actually think that this is the ideal state-of-mind to begin this show with. As such, spoiler tags ahead. Basically, it took me like 4-5 episodes to realize this show was about vampires. This show is terrifying not in its literal horrific aspects, but in its portrayal of the lengths by which humans will go to preserve their own existence. Truly harrowing, this anime left me empty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/13759/Sakura-sou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo">Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo</a>
<ul>
<li>A cute romcom that explores the ideas of mediocrity in the face of overwhelming genius. It provides a path to contentedness following ones realization that, no matter what you are doing, there will always be someone better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</a>
<ul>
<li>Imagine Star Wars but with strategic warfare backed by famous concertos/operas instead of lightsaber fights. One of the first space operas. It explores the age old question of whether one should prefer a poor democracy or an impeccable autocracy. The nuance in this show comes from the fact that it never seeks to answer this question, but merely provides viewers with the necessary prompting to come to their own conclusions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon">Log Horizon</a>
<ul>
<li>What type of political system would arise in a fantasy world running on game logic where the population is comprised of MMO gamers? Log Horizon explores this question in a thorougly intelligent manner. The best isekai by far. This show is largely dialogue-driven, so if you are looking for mainly action-based progression then this show is not for you. See Digibro&rsquo;s youtube analysis series of this show for further details on why it&rsquo;s genius.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Koukaku_Kidoutai__Stand_Alone_Complex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a>
<ul>
<li>The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> film was the progenitor for sci-fi anime and set the tone for the genre. It utilized the setting to address incredibly poigniant themes such as the nature of intelligence and the soul. The spin-off series <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> further pursues these themes with the precision of a scalpel. The show has thematic fish to fry and it isn&rsquo;t afraid to go all in.</li>

<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad__After_Story">Clannad: After Story</a>
<ul>
<li>Even though I skipped the original Clannad, this series still made me ball for days on end. I don&rsquo;t think anything has ever hit me as hard as this show has. Truly an emotional masterpiece.</li>
