      <title>A Thank You Letter to Math</title>

      <description>Dear Mathematics,
I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn&amp;rsquo;t it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming. I&amp;rsquo;m expected to be an &amp;ldquo;adult,&amp;rdquo; whatever that is.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Mathematics,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn&rsquo;t it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming. I&rsquo;m expected to be an &ldquo;adult,&rdquo; whatever that is. I&rsquo;m expected to have thrown away my playful side, to contribute to the mollochian machine that we call industrial society.</p>
<p>Because of you, I have other options. I don&rsquo;t have to forget how to play.</p>
<p>TODO <em>insert picture of young James</em>
Hello there</p>
<p>Oddly enough, through you I have learned an incredible amount about myself. Through you, I have slowly been discovering who I am and what type of person I desire to be.</p>
<p>You are always eager to let me know just how little I know, but honestly, I&rsquo;ve gotten used to that feeling. I actually revel in it now. There is something existentially freeing about knowing full well that I will never know anything and still trying anyways. This awareness keeps me sane. No other subject makes you feel comfortable feeling stupid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taught me so many lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always someone better, so don&rsquo;t make it a race</li>
<li>You will know nothing, and that is okay</li>
<li>We are all just faking it</li>
<li>There is no replacement for hard work. Genius isn&rsquo;t a factor. What you see as genius is likely the culmination of more work than you can imagine.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Why Black Metal?</title>
      <link>https://kyrem1.github.io/musings/blackmetal/</link>

      <description>I never play my favorite genre for others. I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.
A couple times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.
I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never play my favorite genre for others. I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.</p>
<p>A couple times, I&rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal.</p>
<p>Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal.</p>
<h2 id="an-era-of-turmoil--second-wave">An era of turmoil : Second Wave</h2>
<p>The second wave of black metal is marked by stauch anti-christian imagery and senseless violence within the scene. Through the antics of the members of the band Mayhem, black metal earned a twisted place in the eye of the public. This is not the black metal I speak of.</p>

</div>


<p>Mayhem somewhat permanently tainted the public perception of the genre, even within heavy metal circles. Their antics have made it quite difficult for the scene to ever obtain even a morsel of mainstream success.</p>
<p>The second wave style represents the baseline of black metal which further subgenres build upon. For something to even be considered &ldquo;black metal,&rdquo; it must at least take some inspiration from this distinct era.</p>
<h2 id="third-wave">Third Wave</h2>
<p>There are various flavors of black metal with complex emotional storylines:</p>
<ul>
<li>DSBM - Depressive Suicidal Black Metal</li>
<li>ABM - Atmospheric Black Metal</li>
<li>Pacifist Black Metal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="depressive-black-metal-dsbm">Depressive Black Metal (DSBM)</h3>
<p>The first of these, DSBM, is precisely what it sounds like. However, for me at least, the depressive side of the music is somewhat uplifting. Its a hard feeling to explain.</p>
<p>Modern classics in this genre include Leviathan&rsquo;s debut studio album <em>The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide</em>, Thy Light&rsquo;s <em>Suici.De.Pression</em>, and Silencer&rsquo;s <em>Death - Pierce Me</em>.</p>

<p>There is a large number of truly brilliant one person projects in this subgenre, including Leviathan as mentioned above. Noisey did a great 3-part interview series covering Leviathan, Striborg, and Xasthur, all one man DSBM projects.</p>

<h3 id="atmospheric-black-metal">Atmospheric Black Metal</h3>
<p>Atomospheric black metal displays its emotion through a <em>slow burn</em>. It is often said that this music is meant to be listened to outside in the snow. My recommendation for this corner of black metal is the Russian band Путь (&ldquo;put&rdquo;).</p>
<h3 id="pacifist-black-metal">Pacifist Black Metal</h3>
<p>Pacifist black metal is my favorite of the bunch. The majority of bands under this genre are World War I remembrance bands (e.b. Kanonenfieber, Minenwerfer, 1914) . There is a palpable sense of regret in this music, at times somewhat crushing. To see what I&rsquo;m talking about, listen to <em>Der Blutharsch</em> by Minenwerfer (first 17 minutes of the album below) in a single sitting. I can guarantee a religious experience.</p>

<div class="container" style="width: 930px; max-width: 80%;">
  <a class="aimg" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDtXNckpqvc">
  <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3252171933_10.jpg"  >
  </a>
</div>

<p>This subgenre is chalk full of poignant imagery, from the depiction of an Austrian mountaineer soldier on the hills of the Alps in Minenwerfer&rsquo;s <em>Alpenpässe</em> to an anti-war propaganda poster by the Social Democratic Party of Hungary from around 1918 in Kanonenfieber&rsquo;s <em>Menschenmühle</em>, pacifist black metal understands its own importance in serving as a reminder for all those listening: <em>never again</em>.</p>

<p>Clippers are an integral part of the vtuber community and stand as the gatekeepers to the neverending rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="kayfabe">Kayfabe</h2>
<p>Kayfabe is a term from professional wrestling which expresses the convention of presenting the staged performance as genuine/authentic. This term has been adapted to the vtuber scene to mean one&rsquo;s keeping up the illusion of the truth of one&rsquo;s lore.</p>
<p>Whether it be Gura continually claiming to be a shark girl from Atlantis or Fauna professing that she is mother nature, kayfabe is an integral part of the vtuber community. However, unlike wrestling, kayfabe is not the fount from which we derive entertainment from the genre. It is more like a necessary but not sufficient condition to be able to call oneself a genuine vtuber: it won&rsquo;t make you loved by itself, but you must have a kayfabe in order to be successful.</p>
