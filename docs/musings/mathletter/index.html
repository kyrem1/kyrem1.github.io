I hope this letter finds you well. It has been quite the ride together hasn&rsquo;t it. Like a parental figure, you were always in the background of my life. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t notice your presence until High School; I was busy being a kid. As I grow older, purpose has been harder to come by and support has become less forthcoming.
