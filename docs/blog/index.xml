      <description>I never play my favorite genre on the aux. I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly fine with that; I like enough genres that it is never hard to find something that will suit any present company.
A couple times, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.
I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal.</description>

<p>A couple times, I&rsquo;ve been asked about why I enjoy the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that I listen to so much, but my answers have always gotten interrupted. This is the uninteruppted version.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite remember when exactly I discovered black metal. I had been in the metal scene for a while listening to prog metal from bands such as Ne Obliviscaris and Xanathochroid, and I gradually shifted towards the heavier side of metal in Death Metal. I was and still am a major Spawn of Possession and Angelmaker fan. However, one thing that this heavier side of metal lacked in my eyes was emotional depth. Behind the blistering blastbeats and gut-curdling screams, it is hard to find any emotional backbone besides the expression of pure, unadulterated rage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, rage is an emotion that does not quite resonate with me; however, this meant that I had little emotional resonance with the music I was listening to. And then, I discovered black metal.</p>
<p>Black metal is an attempt to add such an emotional backbone to death metal.</p>
